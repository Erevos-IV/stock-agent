# 🧠 AI-Powered Long-Term Investment Agent

A sophisticated Python agent designed for **Long-Term Investors**. It moves beyond simple price trends and looks at **Fundamental Quality** (Margins, Debt) and uses **Google Gemini AI** to interpret the news for you.

## ✨ New Features

  * **🤖 Integrated AI Analyst**: Uses Google's Gemini Pro to read news headlines, summarize the *fundamental impact*, and assign a specific **Sentiment Score (0-100)**.
  * **💎 Quality First**: Prioritizes **Profit Margins** and **Low Debt** over short-term hype.
  * **📉 SMA 200 Trend**: Uses the **200-Day Moving Average** to determine the long-term market cycle (Bull vs Bear).
  * **🛡️ Smart Valuation**: Uses PEG Ratio as the primary metric, but intelligently falls back to **Forward P/E** if PEG data is missing (N/A).

## 🔑 Setup (AI Key Required)

1.  **Get a Free API Key**: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create a key.
2.  **Edit Code**: Open `stock_agent.py` and paste your key:
    ```python
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = "AIzaSy......"
    ```
3.  **Install Requirements**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    python stock_agent.py
    ```

## 🧠 How The Analysis Works (The Logic)

The agent calculates a **Confidence Score (0-100)**. A score of 50 is neutral. Points are added or subtracted based on the following "Long-Term" criteria:

| Category | Condition | Points | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quality (The Moat)** | Profit Margins > 20% | **+15** | High efficiency and competitive advantage. |
| | Profit Margins < 5% | **-15** | Low profitability risk. |
| **Financial Health** | Debt-to-Equity < 50% | **+10** | Very healthy balance sheet. |
| | Debt-to-Equity > 150% | **-15** | High leverage risk. |
| **Valuation** | PEG Ratio < 1.2 | **+20** | Growth is cheap (Value). |
| | PEG Ratio > 2.5 | **-15** | Price is too high for growth. |
| | *Fallback* (If PEG N/A) | **+10** | Forward P/E < 20 (Reasonable Price). |
| **Trend (Timing)** | Price > 200-Day SMA | **+10** | Stock is in a long-term Bull Market. |
| | RSI < 30 (Oversold) | **+10** | Deep value dip opportunity. |
| **AI Sentiment** | AI Score > 70 | **+Var** | AI detects strong fundamental news. |
| **Analyst** | Upside > 20% | **+10** | Wall St. expects price to rise. |

## 📊 Interpreting the Report

  * **Signal**: The final recommendation (STRONG BUY, BUY, HOLD, SELL).
  * **Score**: The strength of the signal (0-100). **>80** is a high-conviction Buy.
  * **AI Outlook**: A smart summary generated by Gemini explaining *why* the stock is moving.
  * **Key Factors**: The specific reasons the stock gained or lost points (e.g., "High Margins, Undervalued").
